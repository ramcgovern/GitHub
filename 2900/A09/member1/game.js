Mod 1: Changed color of beads to change each time they are entered
Mod 2: Changed the sound to play drip2 when entered and swoosh when released
Mod 3: The grid color changes to a random shade of red when the cursor leaves the grid
Mod 4: The border color of each bead changes to a random shade of red each time the cursor enters the bead
Mod 5: The status line text changes to a random shade of red everytime the cursor leaves the grid

Called once after engine is initialized but before event-polling begins.
This function doesn't have to do anything, although initializing the grid dimensions with PS.gridSize() is recommended.
If PS.grid() is not called, the default grid dimensions (8 x 8 beads) are applied.
Any value returned is ignored.
[system : Object] = A JavaScript object containing engine and host platform information properties; see API documentation for details.
[options : Object] = A JavaScript object with optional data properties; see API documentation for details.
